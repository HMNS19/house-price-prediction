# House Price Prediction

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that estimates the prices of houses based on a set of features. The dataset used includes various attributes of houses, such as size, number of rooms, location, etc.

## Project Workflow
The project follows these main steps:

#### 1. Data Loading:
Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

#### 2. Data Exploration:
Analyze the dataset to understand its structure and contents.

#### 3. Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values.
Encode categorical variables.
Normalize or standardize numerical features.

#### 4. Feature Selection:
Select relevant features for model training.


#### 5. Feature Engineering:
Generate additional features from existing ones 

#### 6. Model Building:
Train various regression models to predict house prices.

#### 7. Prediction:
Use the trained model to make predictions on test data.

#### 8. Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
